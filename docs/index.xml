It allows for easy deployment of apps that I or others have made. Docker Compose makes the deployment of container stacks even easier by allowing you to control the containers via a YAML file.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Linux Enthusiast that is currently working as a Systems Administrator at Datayard. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using and tinkering with Linux for around 5 years at this point, both professionally and in my free time.
Over the past few years, I have been growing and fine-tuning a home lab I use as a means of learning new things and experimenting with technology that interests me. I consider it an invaluable tool and has accounted for a large portion of my interest and technical ability.</description>

      <description>Intro I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any full-length tutorials for getting the Apple Magic Trackpad 2, or really any multi-touch track-pad, working in Manjaro, or more specifically KDE, yet. So I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write down how I did it. Most of the info I got was from the libinput-gestures Github page if you would like to check it out. The device works out of the box with left, right, and middle-click as well as 2 finger scrolling.</description>
