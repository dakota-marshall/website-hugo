                <p>I&rsquo;m a Linux Enthusiast that is currently working as a Systems Administrator at Datayard. I&rsquo;ve been using and tinkering with Linux for around 5 years,</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have been growing and fine-tuning a home lab I use as a means of training and education. Testing different technologies and hardware to understand their ins-and-outs. I consider it an invaluable tool and has accounted for a large portion of my interest and technical ability. With my lab and my determination to better myself and learn about the Linux ecosystem, I journeyed down the path to become Red Hat certified as a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator. It was a daunting task that soaked up a lot of late night studying and practicing. At the end, I came out certified and with a much greater understanding of Linux as a production system.</p>
<p>I am always ready for a new challenge and hope to further my career and education in any way I can. My end goal is to work in a Linux production environment working as a Linux Administrator, being able to work with Automation pipelines and managing a production environment.</p>
