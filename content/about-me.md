I am a 22-year-old Linux Enthusiast that is currently working as a Project Engineer, Service and Support Team Lead, and Systems Engineer at Vercom Systems. My background is in Network Engineering and Service and Support, which has laid the foundation for my career. Driven by my desire to learn about anything and everything I can about technology, I seek to implement what I learn to gain a better understanding of it. I love spending time tinkering and toying with new things to learn how they work. Completing a project is one of the most satisfying feelings out there.

At home, my yearning to learn does not waiver. Over the past few years, I have been growing and fine-tuning a home lab I use as a means of training and education. Testing different technologies and hardware to understand their ins-and-outs. I consider it an invaluable tool and has accounted for a large portion of my interest and technical ability. With my lab and my determination to better myself and learn about the Linux ecosystem, I journeyed down the path to become Red Hat certified as a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator. It was a daunting task that soaked up a lot of late night studying and practicing. At the end, I came out certified and with a much greater understanding of Linux as a production system.

I am always ready for a new challenge and hope to further my career and education in any way I can. My end goal is to work in a Linux production environment working as a Linux Administrator, being able to work with Automation pipelines and managing a production environment.
