# Website

This is the source code for my site. Its using Hugo to generate static sites in `/docs`

After editing with Hugo, build with `hugo -D -d docs/`. Github pages will automatically depploy the new build once pushed to prod.

Ensure to init and download the theme submodule once cloned:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
